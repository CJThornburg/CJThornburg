### Hello there 👋

I am open to opportunities. 

I just finished the [ApexFriends](https://github.com/CJThornburg/APEXFriends), a personal project and deployed using heroku. 
Deployment can be access at https://apex-friends.herokuapp.com/ 

I also worked with a few local orginizations to design and develop a website for their coalition: 
[Defund Nova Police](https://www.defundnovapolice.net/)

Colaberated with several developers on another campaign website. [Green New Schools](https://greennewschools.com/) which used Hugo as a framework.

Right now, I am working on my React skills ⚛️.

 
You can learn more about me on my [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-thornburg-40b81297/)
